To avoid ak&sk leaks, you can input your ak&sk through the command line with '-s' param like this
```shell
./cloudeye-exporter -s true
```
To startup the cloudeye-exporter using script, here is an example
```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Don't write plain text ak&sk in script.
# Encrypt the ak&sk instead and use your own decrypt function to assign the return value.
huaweiCloud_AK=your_decrypt_function("your encrypted ak")
huaweiCloud_SK=your_decrypt_function("your encrypted sk")
$(./cloudeye-exporter -s true<<EOF
$huaweiCloud_AK $huaweiCloud_SK
EOF)
```

## Help

  scrape_batch_size: 300
  resource_sync_interval_minutes: 20 # Update frequency of resource information: resource information is updated every 180 minutes by default; If this parameter is set to a value less than 10 minutes, the information is updated every 10 minutes.
  ep_ids: "xxx1,xxx2" # This is optional. Filter resources by enterpries project, cloudeye-exporter will get all resources when this is empty, if you need multiple enterprise project, use comma split them.

## Example of endpoint file(endpoints.yml)
European site users should configure the domain names of the rms and eps services as follows.
```
"rms":
  "https://rms.myhuaweicloud.eu"

  "https://eps.eu-west-101.myhuaweicloud.eu"
```
Other site users should not configure anything in this file.

## Prometheus Configuration
The huaweicloud exporter needs to be passed the address as a parameter, this can be done with relabelling.

Example config:

```
global:
  scrape_interval: 1m # Set the scrape interval to every 1 minute seconds. Default is every 1 minute.
  scrape_timeout: 1m
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'huaweicloud'
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['10.0.0.10:8087']
    params:
      services: ['SYS.VPC,SYS.ELB']
```
